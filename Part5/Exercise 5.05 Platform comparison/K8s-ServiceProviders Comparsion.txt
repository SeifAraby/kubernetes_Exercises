Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
• Ease of Use:
  • User-friendly interface with intuitive controls for deploying and managing clusters.
• Integration:
  • Seamless integration with GCP services (e.g., BigQuery, Cloud Storage).
• Deployment Options:
  • Offers Autopilot mode for automated node management and scaling.
• Scaling:
  • Advanced features like vertical pod autoscaling for efficient resource usage.
• Security:
  • Strong security features with automatic upgrades and built-in vulnerability scanning.
• Multi-Cloud Support:
  • Supports hybrid and multi-cloud deployments with Anthos.
• Global Network:
  • Benefits from Google’s global fiber-optic network for low latency and high availability.
• Monitoring:
  • Integrated monitoring and logging via Google Cloud Operations Suite.
• Cost Efficiency:
  • Competitive pricing with sustained use discounts.
• Community Support:
  • Smaller community compared to AWS, but still active.

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
• Ease of Use:
  • More complex setup requiring configuration of AWS services.
• Integration:
  • Deep integration with other AWS services (e.g., IAM, RDS).
• Deployment Options:
  • Flexibility with deployment on EC2 and Fargate for serverless options.
• Scaling:
  • Managed node scaling available but can be complex to configure.
• Security:
  • Good security options with IAM roles for service accounts but requires more manual setup.
• Multi-Cloud Support:
  • Limited multi-cloud capabilities.
• Global Network:
  • Leverages AWS global infrastructure for application deployment.
• Monitoring:
  • Integrated monitoring available through Amazon CloudWatch.
• Cost Efficiency:
  • Potentially higher costs due to additional AWS services.
• Community Support:
  • Larger community with extensive resources available.
